# Implementation Plan

## Conceptual Checklist

- Analyze the current routing structure and placeholder home component
- Review existing module architecture to understand component patterns
- Identify UI components and state management patterns used in the application
- Determine the role-based content requirements for the home screen
- Plan the creation of a home module following established patterns
- Design the home screen with appropriate features and visual hierarchy
- Update routing to integrate the new home component

## Overview

The request is to create a proper home screen for the application, organize it within a dedicated "home" module following the existing module-based architecture, and replace the current placeholder in AppRoutes.tsx. The home screen should provide a meaningful landing page with role-appropriate content, navigation options, and potentially key metrics or quick actions based on user permissions.

## Assumptions and Rules from CLAUDE.md

**From Project CLAUDE.md:**
- Follow module-based architecture: Each module should contain components/, stores/, types/, and relevant query/mutation files
- Use Material UI + Emotion for styling
- Implement role-based access control using ROLES constants
- Use Zustand for local state management
- Use React Query for server state
- Use Formik + Yup for form handling if needed
- Follow existing code conventions and patterns

**From Global CLAUDE.md:**
- ALWAYS prefer editing existing files to creating new ones
- NEVER proactively create documentation files unless requested
- Do only what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less
- Check existing components to understand patterns before creating new ones
- Follow existing naming conventions and framework choices

**Assumptions:**
- The home screen should be accessible to all authenticated users
- It should display role-appropriate content and quick actions
- The design should align with the existing Material UI theme
- The home module should follow the same structure as other modules

**Ambiguities/Missing Rules:**
- Specific content requirements for the home screen are not defined - Resolution: Create a dashboard-style home with role-based sections
- Whether to include data fetching/API integration - Resolution: Start with static content and UI, API integration can be added later if needed

## Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Create home module directory structure**
   - Dependencies: None
   - Tools/Files: Bash (mkdir), file system operations
   - Create src/modules/home with subdirectories for components and types

2. **Analyze existing component patterns**
   - Dependencies: Understanding of current codebase
   - Tools/Files: Read existing module components (e.g., TenantManagementPage, UserManagementPage)
   - Extract common patterns for page components, Material UI usage, and role-based rendering

3. **Design and implement HomePage component**
   - Dependencies: Material UI, React Router, role constants
   - Tools/Files: Create src/modules/home/components/HomePage.tsx
   - Include: Welcome section, role-based quick actions, navigation cards, statistics placeholder

4. **Implement role-based content sections**
   - Dependencies: useUserRoles hook, ROLES constants
   - Tools/Files: HomePage.tsx
   - Create conditional rendering for Super Admin, Admin, and User specific content

5. **Create supporting components (if needed)**
   - Dependencies: Material UI components
   - Tools/Files: QuickActionCard.tsx, DashboardMetrics.tsx (optional)
   - Build reusable components for the home screen layout

6. **Update AppRoutes.tsx**
   - Dependencies: HomePage component
   - Tools/Files: Edit src/routes/AppRoutes.tsx
   - Replace HomePagePlaceholder with the new HomePage component
   - Update import statement

7. **Test and validate**
   - Dependencies: npm run dev, npm run lint
   - Tools/Files: Browser testing, linting tools
   - Verify role-based rendering, navigation, and visual consistency

## Error Handling and Uncertainties

**Potential Issues:**
1. **Import path conflicts** - Mitigation: Use absolute imports or verify relative paths
2. **Role permission conflicts** - Mitigation: Test with different user roles to ensure proper access
3. **Material UI theme inconsistencies** - Mitigation: Use theme variables and follow existing component patterns
4. **Build/lint errors** - Mitigation: Run npm run lint:fix and address any TypeScript errors

**Uncertainties:**
1. **Specific metrics or data to display** - Currently planning static placeholders that can be connected to APIs later
2. **Navigation flow from home** - Will use existing navigation patterns and RouterNavLink components
3. **Mobile responsiveness requirements** - Will follow Material UI responsive patterns used in MainLayout
