### Cascade - AI Assistant

Windsurf features a powerful AI assistant called "Cascade" that appears in a panel on the right side of the editor. With Cascade, you can:

- Chat about your code
- Get coding assistance
- Generate entire projects
- Run code analysis

## üéÆ Core Features

### AI Assistant

Access the Windsurf AI assistant by pressing `Alt+Space` (or `Option+Space` on Mac) to:

- Generate code based on natural language descriptions
- Refactor existing code
- Debug problems
- Get code explanations
- Optimize performance

### Smart Code Completion

Windsurf's AI provides context-aware code completion that goes beyond traditional autocompletion:

- Complete entire functions based on comments or function signatures
- Suggest appropriate patterns based on your codebase
- Automatically import required dependencies

### Conversational AI Interface

- Hold conversations with the AI about your code
- Reference specific parts of your codebase
- Ask follow-up questions with context retained

## üõ†Ô∏è Understanding Windsurf Rules and Memories

Windsurf provides a powerful system for customizing AI behavior through rules and memories. These features help create a more personalized coding experience that understands your preferences and project requirements.

### Memories System

Memories in Windsurf allow for sharing and persisting context across conversations, creating a more coherent experience as you work.

#### Automatic Memories

During conversation, Cascade can automatically generate and store memories when it encounters useful context:

- These memories are associated with the workspace where they were created
- Cascade retrieves them when they're relevant to your current task
- Memories from one workspace are not available in another
- Creating and using auto-generated memories does not consume credits

#### Managing Memories

Access the Memories panel by:

1. Clicking on "Windsurf - Settings" in the bottom-right corner
2. Selecting the "Settings" tab
3. Clicking "Manage" next to "Cascade-Generated Memories"

Alternatively:

- Click the three dots in the top-right corner of the Cascade window
- Select "Manage Memories"

#### Creating Manual Memories

You can ask Cascade to create a memory at any time with prompts like:

- "Create a memory of our project structure"
- "Remember that we're using Material UI for components"

### The Two Layers of Windsurf Rules

Windsurf implements a two-layer approach to rules that allows for both global and project-specific customization.

#### 1. Global Rules (global_rules.md)

Global rules apply across all workspaces and projects, establishing core principles that Cascade will follow regardless of which project you're working on.

**Location**: Stored in your user profile settings
**Filename**: `global_rules.md`
**Format**: Markdown

**Purpose**:

- Set Cascade's overall personality and problem-solving approach
- Define general coding standards you prefer across all projects
- Establish core principles for all AI interactions
- Set default behaviors regardless of project

**Example of Global Rules**:

```markdown
# Global Coding Principles

## Code Style

- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Prefer readability over cleverness
- Comment complex logic, not obvious operations
- Keep functions small and focused

## Development Approach

- Write tests for all new features
- Consider edge cases in implementations
- Optimize for maintainability first, performance second

## Documentation

- Document public APIs thoroughly
- Include examples in documentation
- Explain the "why" not just the "what"
```

#### 2. Project-Specific Rules (.windsurfrules)

A file in your project root that customizes Cascade's behavior for your specific project.

**Location**: At the root of your project directory
**Filename**: `.windsurfrules`
**Format**: Markdown

**Purpose**:

- Define project-specific coding standards
- Explain the architectural patterns of your project
- Set quality control requirements
- Reference project documentation and patterns

**Example for a React project**:

```markdown
# React Project Standards

## Component Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks
- Follow atomic design principles
- Keep components small and focused
- Co-locate related files (component, test, styles)

## State Management

- Use React Context for global state
- Prefer local state when possible
- Use Redux only for complex state requirements
- Follow immutability patterns

## Styling Approach

- Use CSS modules for component styling
- Follow BEM naming convention
- Maintain a consistent color scheme
- Reference our design system (@docs/design-system.md)
```

**Character Limits**:

- `global_rules.md` and `.windsurfrules` are each limited to 6000 characters
- Any content beyond 6000 characters will be truncated
- If your window has multiple workspaces, the `.windsurfrules` from each workspace will be applied
- Total character limit across all rules is 12,000 characters, with priority given to global rules

### Best Practices for Windsurf Rules

#### 1. Keep Rules Concise and Specific

```markdown
# Bad (too vague)

- Write good code
- Follow best practices

# Good (specific and actionable)

- Use async/await instead of Promises with .then()
- Include type annotations for function parameters
- Handle errors with try/catch blocks
```

#### 2. Use Formatting for Clarity

Use bullet points, numbered lists, and markdown formatting to make your rules easier for Cascade to follow:

```markdown
# Coding Standards

1. **Naming Conventions**

   - Use camelCase for variables and functions
   - Use PascalCase for classes and components
   - Use UPPERCASE for constants

2. **File Organization**
   - One component per file
   - Group related files in feature folders
   - Keep index files for exports only
```

#### 3. Use XML Tags for Grouping Rules

XML tags can help communicate and group similar rules effectively:

```markdown
<code_style>

- Use 2 spaces for indentation
- Limit line length to 80 characters
- Use semicolons at the end of statements
- Use single quotes for strings
  </code_style>

<architecture>
- Follow container/component pattern
- Use custom hooks for reusable logic
- Keep business logic out of components
</architecture>
```

#### 4. Add to .gitignore (OPTIONAL)

To ensure project-specific rules are only applied to your local project:

- Add `.windsurfrules` to your project's `.gitignore` file

## üöÄ Best Practices

### Effective AI Collaboration

- Be specific in your requests to the AI
- Provide context when asking questions
- Start with clear instructions when generating code
- Iterate on AI-generated code to refine it

## üîÑ Updates

Stay up-to-date with the latest features:

1. Open the Help menu
2. Select "Check for Updates"
3. Follow the prompts to install any available updates

Alternatively:

- Click on your Profile icon dropdown > Check for Updates
